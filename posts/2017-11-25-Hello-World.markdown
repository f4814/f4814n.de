So, what am I going to do with this blog?

<!--more-->

That's a very good question. And at the moment I know as much as you.
I'll write (about) everything I want to, so you should expect mostly
technology centered stuff but this (probably) won't be the only topic here.

I'll at least try to do some writing at all, because it is a great opportunity to
"talk" about my hobby and train my English at the same time.
